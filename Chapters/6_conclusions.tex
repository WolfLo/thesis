\chapter{Conclusions} \label{ch:conclusions}

\section{Future works}
\begin{itemize}
\item Future work should focus on finding more efficient (but still effective) ways to perform optimization in
the infinite-arm setting
\item applying OPTIMIST also
to the action-based framework, which requires additional
caveats in computing the exploration bonus.
\item find a way to transition to a more exploitative behaviour after having explored enough, \eg reference to MC comparison \ref{fig:MCcomparison} 
\end{itemize}
